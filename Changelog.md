##            CHANGELOG

**1.2.3** - [2023.04.25] A rainy and decently hot April Tuesday
<br/>

	A bunch of new categories, sounds, and some updated names!

	Starting off with the latter, to prevent potential future conflicts regarding names:
	I've renamed a few directories and IRs to reflect a more generic title. The samples themselves
	remain unchanged, but these names are incompatible with previous versions. Sorry!

	Ok now for the fun stuff, it's not a massive collection this time around but I've got some
	weird gear and cool rooms added in, and some really basic color-bass inspired chromatic bits.

	Added the following categories and subcategories:
	 + Esoteric Hardware/2000s Digital Piano
	 + Esoteric Hardware/Tiny T-Shirt Amplifier
	 + Rooms/Commercial/Hotels/Ballrooms

**1.2.2** - [2023.01.11] A sunny and cool January Wednesday
<br/>

	A variety of new household and other impulses!

	The largest and most noticeable set from this batch will be the SSM-1750 ones, I've included
	both SDIR and WAV for all of these because they are True Stereo. I've grabbed responses for
	different channel configurations as well as a relatively thorough sweep of settings from the
	unit's delay. I already made 3 IRs previously from this unit which were not recorded True
	Stereo, so no SDIR for them. The Balance Right Full IR is a mirror edited version of the Left
	counterpart, as I mistakenly did not record that one TS in the original session. It should be
	essentially exactly the same as what one would expect anyway, but in case that is important
	info to someone there you have it. These have very light noise reduction so in some of them
	one may hear aliasing artifacts.

	I also grabbed (another!) sustain pedal IR of the Winter Upright, knowing this time I could
	get a nicer clean one having been a little more prepared with adequate gear on hand. I decided
	to call this new one "Hyper Sustain" because the tuning has since changed a little again (thanks
	to the weather). It should still be relatively in tune and have quite a clean and long tail.

	The first time I attempted to record the toilet bowl IR I ultimately dropped my field recorder
	in the toilet. Fortunately it survived with no harm, however, the resulting responses were not
	very good. So it endured another scary round of recording, safely and more securely. The new
	IR was good, and I will likely not be creating more of this type soon.

**1.2.1** - [2022.12.22] An overcast, moderate December Thursday
<br/>

	More impulses, a retuned piano (sort of), and small memos.
	
	Regarding the new piano impulses, they come from the same Winter upright piano as the
	originals, the first and only piano I've ever owned (as of writing). I spent about 4 hours
	learning how to tune a piano, with mild success. The result is that all the strings now
	roughly hover over a more correct pitch center, and most of the strings are much less
	locally detuned. I didn't get it perfect, however, but I think having IRs that are more in
	tune will be generall much more useful to most people.

	The "Basilica Dome Glass Bowls" come from the bowl-shaped scraps of glass pieces that were
	blown for a section of the dome in the Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri basilica in
	Rome. They were recorded using a delicately-placed contact mic + a soft and fearful sine sweep.
	Paranoia and respect required that I must absolutely not break or damage the pieces, and so
	especially in the little bowl an aggressive noise floor meant heavy post production, and
	relatively mild results. I still think they're cool though, and someday I'll hopefully revisit
	and make nicer ones.

	Added the following subcategories:
	 + Formant and Resonant/Basilica Dome Glass Bowls
	 + Strings/Winter Upright/New Retuned
	 + Strings/Winter Upright/Original Detuned
	
	Added the following impulse responses:
	Formant and Resonant

	 + Basilica Dome Glass Bowls Little
	 + Basilica Dome Glass Bowls Nested
	Strings
	 + Winter Upright Closed Bass Sustain
	 + Winter Upright Closed Default
	 + Winter Upright Closed Sustain
	 + Winter Upright Open Bass Sustain
	 + Winter Upright Open Default

**1.2.0** - [2022.09.20] A thunderstorm-filled Tuesday
<br/>

	New impulses, new documentation + README changes

	+ README now includes the current, latest version in the absense of an embedded changelog.
	+ README now includes a contributors section, to be expanded.
	+ A new background info document for the new Menorcan bunker impulses courtesy of Gater.

	Added the following category:
	+ Rooms/Historical/Menorcan Spanish Civil War Bunkers

	Added the following impulse responses:
	Rooms
	+ Bunker 1 Entry Far
	+ Bunker 1 Entry Near
	+ Bunker 1 Rear Back
	+ Bunker 1 Rear Back Center

	+ Bunker 2 Stair Bottom
	+ Bunker 2 Stair Top
	Utility
	+ Unit Silence


**1.1.1** - [2022.09.11] The Sunday afternoon after
<br/>

	A proper license has been decided!

	And it's the MIT License:
	+ Added License.md containing the license agreement for the usage of this library.
	+ Separated the INFO + AGREEMENT section into new Info, Sentiment, and License sections.
	  Info gives an overview and some technical info, while sentiment offers some of the
	  purpose and decision-making insight. License links the user to the new License.md file.
	
	To briefly mirror why this license was chosen, as is discussed in the new sentiment
	section, I felt its balance of permissiveness and legal clarity suited the project well.

	No attribution and the ability to modify and allow commercial use are important to me,
	and I want others to be aware of that. This license allows that and is familiar to many
	which will hopefully make the intent understood. The agreement until now that I have
	included felt like it was headed in this direction, and needed some clarity.


**1.1.0** - [2022.09.10] An hot and rainy Saturday
<br/>

	Quality of life improvements, and new sounds!

	+ README now includes approximate file size and additional info about the project scope.
	+ The changelog has been separated into a new markdown document, the README will now link
	  to the changelog via a relative link at the header where the changelog previous was.
	- Adjusted directory structure, removing the separation of IR file formats by folders
	  and opting to move them up to root level. The presets are still separated in folders
	  one layer deep. This makes perusing both raw audio and presets easier in the browsers
	  of most convolvers, so incompatible files may be ignored and extra folders don't
	  appear when unnecessary.
	+ Prefaced IR subcategory types to include names, as to make all impulse file folders
	  adjacent while grouped with preset folders (Conner Plate I/Impacts > ../Plate I Impacts)
	+ Addition of .gitignore, now no longer including some hidden macOS files such as those
	  prefixed with ._ and .DS_Store

	Added the following categories and subcategories:
	+ Outdoors/Public
	+ Outdoors/Public/Bower Ponds
	+ Outdoors/Public/Playgrounds
	+ Rooms/Commercial/Craft Coffee Shop
	+ Rooms/Historical/Drumheller's Little Church

	Fixed and renamed the following broken impulse responses:
	Strings

	+ Sustain 2 iPhone -> Winter Upright Damper 3

	Added the following impulse responses:
	Outdoors
