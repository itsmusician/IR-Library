##            CHANGELOG

**1.2.0** - [2022.09.20] A thunderstorm-filled Tuesday
<br/>

	New impulses, new documentation + edits

	+ README now includes the current, latest version in the absense of an embedded changelog.
	+ README now includes a contributors section, to be expanded.
	+ A new background info document for the new Menorcan bunker impulses courtesy of Gater.

	Added the following category:
	+ Rooms/Historical/Menorcan Spanish Civil War Bunkers

	Added the following impulse responses:
	Rooms
	+ Bunker 1 Entry Far
	+ Bunker 1 Entry Near
	+ Bunker 1 Rear Back
	+ Bunker 1 Rear Back Center
	+ Bunker 1 Rear Center
	+ Bunker 1 Rear Front Center
	+ Bunker 1 Rear Front

	+ Bunker 2 Stair Top
	Utility

**1.1.1** - [2022.09.11] The Sunday afternoon after
<br/>

	A proper license has been decided!

	And it's the MIT License:
	+ Added License.md containing the license agreement for the usage of this library.
	+ Separated the INFO + AGREEMENT section into new Info, Sentiment, and License sections.
	  Info gives an overview and some technical info, while sentiment offers some of the
	  purpose and decision-making insight. License links the user to the new License.md file.
	
	To briefly mirror why this license was chosen, as is discussed in the new sentiment
	section, I felt its balance of permissiveness and legal clarity suited the project well.

	No attribution and the ability to modify and allow commercial use are important to me,
	and I want others to be aware of that. This license allows that and is familiar to many
	which will hopefully make the intent understood. The agreement until now that I have
	included felt like it was headed in this direction, and needed some clarity.


**1.1.0** - [2022.09.10] An hot and rainy Saturday
<br/>

	Quality of life improvements, and new sounds!

	+ README now includes approximate file size and additional info about the project scope.
	+ The changelog has been separated into a new markdown document, the README will now link
	  to the changelog via a relative link at the header where the changelog previous was.
	- Adjusted directory structure, removing the separation of IR file formats by folders
	  and opting to move them up to root level. The presets are still separated in folders
	  one layer deep. This makes perusing both raw audio and presets easier in the browsers
	  of most convolvers, so incompatible files may be ignored and extra folders don't
	  appear when unnecessary.
	+ Prefaced IR subcategory types to include names, as to make all impulse file folders
	  adjacent while grouped with preset folders (Conner Plate I/Impacts > ../Plate I Impacts)
	+ Addition of .gitignore, now no longer including some hidden macOS files such as those
	  prefixed with ._ and .DS_Store

	+ Outdoors/Public
	+ Outdoors/Public/Bower Ponds

	+ Sustain 2 iPhone -> Winter Upright Damper 3

	Added the following impulse responses:
	Outdoors
