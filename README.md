# Conner's Impulse Response Library :)

A public library of impulse responses for anyone to use freely under the [MIT License.](/License.md)
<br/>

Version: 2.0.0
<br/><br/><br/>

## Info

This library contains many impulse responses of a great variety,
from all kinds of locations, rooms, gear, objects, instruments, and more!

You can download this library from either the releases section on the side, or by clicking the
green "Code" button, then download zip.

Currently, the library is ~1 GB uncompressed and contains 738 IRs.

Enjoy!

I created some of the factory impulses for the Kilohearts Convolver and I'm really proud of them!

## Sentiment

It's my hope to provide a really good starting point for anyone needing a collection of
impulse responses, for any variety of professional or personal projects. I love being
able to use impulses to put a sound in a new location, process it wildly, or have it
occupy a fresh musical context. I hope to give others that same freedom, therefore this
library exists. The nature of this library is more creative than scientific.

I've decided that assigning a very open license, the MIT License, will help this project
fulfill that objective and let my intentions for the library to be very permissive become
both legally and practically explicit. No attribution and the ability to modify and allow
commercial use are important to me, and the previous agreement up to the adoption of this
license felt lacking in explicit permission. The requirement of the license to be carried
on in subsequent and derivative or modified versions will hopefully enforce the permissive
nature of this library, and continue to allow these IRs to be accessible and useful.

The license may be found below.

## Contributors

The following people / orgs have directly contributed and helped make this library better
either by means of original raw recording sessions for me to create IRs from or by
contributing their own IRs -- both of which they had all the necessary rights to and
ownership of, and acknowledge that by contributing them, those IRs fall under the
licensing terms of this project (The MIT License), free for anyone to use.

Thank you:
