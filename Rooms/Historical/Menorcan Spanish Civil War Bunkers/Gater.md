I'd like to say a special thank you to Gater, for taking the time
to perform, record, and share these with me so that they could be
edited and added to this library.

Unique locations are always such a treat to be able to use, and
are some of my favorite IRs to make too. These are no exception
-- they started out as modest field recordings of claps inside a
couple old spanish civil war bunkers on Menorca, and quickly and
easily became fun and unusual places to put sounds within.

The processing technique was to spectrally flatten the claps a
little bit (relative to the transient or 'peak' of each) so that
the IRs wouldn't come out feeling too midrange-focused. From there
some de-noising, careful fading, and other post prepped them to be
more suitably used as responses, especially to get the decays
feeling correct.

The results aren't perfect and in these you can especially get a
sense of the imbalanced resonance and imaging in the bunkers.
That's why I like these. They implicitly tell a story about an
idea to document a cool place and the specific limitations that
let it happen, and there's nothing else quite like them.

Thank you again Gater,
